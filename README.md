# todoGoals.io
Hello everyone, I have finally completed ToDoGoals web applications hosted on Heroku and the MongoDB Atlas database.
The /list name allows us to create custom todo goals lists by creating items and then deleting them. This would create a work list separate from the default list.
ex: localhost:3000/work
During the upcoming update I will add the login feature.
I build this course by Angela Yu web development course.
The link for the web app is :
